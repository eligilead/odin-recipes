      I love this recipe because it's low maintenance, so I can put it in the
      oven and then finish odd tasks around my apartment while it cooks (as
      long as I set my timer to remind myself). There's something comforting
      about digging up the thick pieces of lasagna noodles smothered in
      garlicky red sauce. Plus, the spinach makes me feel like it's a little
      bit healthy.

        <li>Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Add 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.

        </li>
