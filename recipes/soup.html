      <h3 class="sub-heading">Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and
          celery and saute 3 minutes. Add garlic and saute 1 minute longer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in chicken broth and water. Add split peas, bay leaves and thyme.
          Season lightly with salt and with pepper to taste (I like to wait to
          add more salt until the end to see how salty the ham has made the
          soup).
        </li>
        <li>
          Nestle ham bone into soup mixture. Bring mixture to a boil, then
          reduce to low. Cover and let simmer, stirring occasionally until peas
          and ham are tender, about 60 - 80 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove ham from soup, let rest 10 minutes then shred or dice meat
          portion into pieces, cover.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile add carrots* to soup. Cover soup and continue to simmer,
          stirring occasionally, until peas have mostly broken down, about 30
          minutes longer**.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir ham into soup, season with more salt as needed. Serve warm
          garnished with parsley if desired.
        </li>
