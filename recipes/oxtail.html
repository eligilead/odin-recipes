        Here is a midwinter cook-up of deep fragrance and lingering heat, a
        trade-wind stew that emerged in Jamaica and made its way north. It is
        oxtail stew, brown and steaming, light with ginger and thyme, pungent
        with allspice and soy, a taste of the Caribbean to warm winter's heart.
        You could make and eat it today while reading Derek Walcott poems as the
        afternoon vagues into indigo — or allow it to cure into greater
        magnificence overnight, and stretch out its gravy for the course of a
        week.

      <h3 class="sub-heading">Steps</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Season oxtails aggressively with salt and pepper. Heat a large Dutch
          oven or a heavy-bottomed pot over high heat. Add brown sugar to pot
          and melt, stirring with a wooden spoon, until it darkens and starts to
          smoke ­— about six minutes. When sugar is nearly black, add 2
          tablespoons boiling water. (It will splatter.) Stir to mix.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the oxtails to the pot, working in batches, stirring each time to
          cover them with blackened sugar, then allowing them to cook, turning
          occasionally, until they are well browned. Remove oxtails to a bowl
          and keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add half of the onions, garlic and ginger to the pot, along with the
          pepper, the thyme, the allspice and a third of the scallions, and stir
          to combine. Allow to cook until softened, approximately 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return the oxtails to the pot along with any accumulated juices and
          put water into the pot so that the oxtails are almost submerged. Bring
          to a simmer and then cook, covered, approximately 1 hour, stirring
          occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add remaining onions, garlic and ginger to the pot, along with another
          third of the scallions. Add sugar, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce.
          Stir to combine and continue to cook until the meat is yielding and
          loose on the bone, approximately one hour longer. Remove approximately
          one cup of liquid from pot and place in a small bowl. Add flour to
          this liquid and stir to combine, working out any lumps with the back
          of a spoon. Add this slurry to the pot along with ketchup, then stir
          to combine and allow to cook a further 15 minutes or so. Remove Scotch
          bonnet pepper and thyme stems. Fold butter beans into the stew and
          allow these to heat through. Scatter remaining scallions over the top.
          Serve with white rice or rice and peas.
